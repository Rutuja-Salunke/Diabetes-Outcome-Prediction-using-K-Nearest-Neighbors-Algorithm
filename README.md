# Diabetes Outcome Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
- **Objective:** The primary goal of the project is to analyze and predict diabetes outcomes based on a dataset related to diabetes.

- **Data Gathering:**
  - The dataset is obtained from a CSV file containing diabetes-related information.
  - The data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Basic information about the dataset is explored using functions like `info()`, `describe()`, `dtypes`, `columns`, and `isna().sum()`.
  - A count plot is generated to visualize the distribution of the target variable "Outcome."

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Outliers in the dataset are identified using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
  - A function `Finding_outliar1` is defined to replace outliers with the upper or lower tail values based on the IQR.

- **Model Training:**
  - The dataset is split into features (`x`) and the target variable (`y`).
  - Further, the data is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
  - Standardization is applied to the dataset using `StandardScaler` to bring features to a similar scale.
  - A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is chosen as the machine learning algorithm.
  - The KNN model is instantiated and trained on the training set using `fit()`.
  - Predictions are made on the test set using the trained KNN model with `predict()`.

- **Model Evaluation:**
  - The confusion matrix is calculated using `confusion_matrix` to evaluate the performance of the KNN model.
  - The accuracy score is computed using `accuracy_score` to measure the overall correctness of the predictions.

- **Conclusion:**
  - The project demonstrates the application of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for diabetes outcome prediction.
  - Standardization is employed to enhance model performance.
  - The analysis includes an examination of outliers to ensure data quality.
